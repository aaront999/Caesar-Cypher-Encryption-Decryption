## Caesar Cypher Encryption/Decryption Project

### Description: 

A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages, it's named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate privately with his generals. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted (typically) by 3 spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 would encode an A as a D, an M as an P, and a Z as an C, and so on.

### Decryption method: 

Apply the same number of shifts in the opposite direction to decrypt the ciphertext!

#
### Pro:

Messages can be translated and responded to quickly & requires limited computing resources (only requires one type of key).

### Con:

A brute force attack is the most common method to break a Caesar Cipher. In this approach, you try each possible shift from 1 to 25 until you get a meaningful message. Caesar Cipher has only 26 possible shifts.

### Modern Use:

The Caesar cipher is not widely used today because it's easy to break. However, a variation called ROT13 is still used to make parts of a message less understandable. ROT13 stands for "rotate by 13 places".
